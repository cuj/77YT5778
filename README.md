Note: **These proxies aren't any proxies! these are proxies from free and really fast (but maybe logging) chrome VPNs with millions of users combined, with extremely fast servers while being used by thousands at the same time. while these are fast proxies from fast VPNs, please keep in mind that these servers may log, it means that any action you (or anyone) does while connected to one of these proxies will get recorded to the server's logs.**

Q: and What is the use?!

A: It's used to avoid rate limiting or evade bans, or btureforcing, *or even DDoS a server/website* <--- please don't do that, for example when you get 429, a good bypass is using proxy, or if needed to send too many requests and bypass 429, a better bypass is using proxy list.

Q: Why 3 json files but one proxies raw txt?

A: I could not find a way to merge all three json into one json, however I can get all proxies from 3 json files and merge it into one plain text.

Q: Real API?

A: Sorry, I cannot provide the real APIs, but the minified json files are straight from the APIs and if the APIs change then the minified json will also change in under a second.
