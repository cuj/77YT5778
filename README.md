Note: **These proxies aren't any proxies! these are proxies from free and really fast (but maybe logging) chrome VPNs with millions of users combined, with extremely fast servers while being used by thousands at the same time. while these are fast proxies from fast VPNs, please keep in mind that these servers may log, it means that any action you (or anyone) does while connected to one of these proxies will get recorded to the server's logs.**

Q: and What is the use?!

A: It's used to avoid rate limiting or evade bans, or btureforcing, *or even DDoS a server/website* <--- please don't do that, for example when you get 429, a good bypass is using proxy, or if needed to send too many requests and bypass 429, a better bypass is using proxy list.
